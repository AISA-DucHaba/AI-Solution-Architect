        "\n",
        "1. **Positive and Uplifting Service:** Ensure that the horoscopes provided are fun, positive, uplifting, and empowering for users of all ages. Aim for at least 90% positive feedback from users on the overall tone and helpfulness of the horoscope readings and images.\n",
        "  - **Achieved:** The output horoscope text and images is fun and uplifting. The prompt templates can expand beyound the 5 input parameters. The image prompt template can be improve with UI/UIx help.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **User Engagement:** Measure the average time users spend interacting with the app and ensure the generated images align with the horoscope text's themes. Target a minimum of 5 minutes per session.\n",
        "  - **Not yet:** Can only measure after UI/UIx and deployment, but it is achievable.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Development Cost and Schedule:** Maintain a development budget of **$100** and complete the project within a **four-day** (can extend longer but only **32 billable hours**) timeline. Leverage GenAI to optimize the efficiency of development, UI/UX, design, and DevOps processes.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - **On Target:** Using OpenAI GPT-4o model tokens. The development phase and QA token cost about **$0.80** (achieve by using GenAI as a coding assistant). Developmet time **2 hours** (so far). Unsure on UI/UIx and deployment cost.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Quality Assurance and Compliance:** Ensure quality checks, legal reviews, and fairness research. Ensure the app meets all standards and provides unbiased, high-quality content. Using the Data-Driven methodology checklist as a guide.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - **Delay**: Base on #3, we don't have time or resource to do this. Unless we have more resource and people joining the project, than we could achieve this KPI.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Real-World Experience:** The target goal is to gain practical experience in developing a GenAI project and to use it as a reference for future opportunities. Ensure that the project is documented effectively for inclusion in resumes and professional portfolios.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - **On Target:** This Jupyter Notebook can served and encouraged student in the AI Solution Architect course to complete this Horoscope project or doing their project."
