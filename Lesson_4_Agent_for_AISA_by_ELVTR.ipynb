That is the hidden risk of “vibe coding”: endpoints that look correct, tests that pass, and security gaps that only appear in production, incident reviews, or audits.\\xa0\\r\\n\\r\\nReport for duty with a former Green Beret turned application security expert, Michael Burch, as your drill sergeant. In this bootcamp webinar, you will learn how to keep AI productive without letting it compromise your security posture. Convert fuzzy feature ideas into LLM-ready specs that remove guesswork. Build systems with sharp interfaces so AI changes stay contained and reviewable. Teach your tools the map of your repo, trust boundaries, data sensitivity, and standing rules so critical constraints are never lost in the field.\\xa0\\r\\n\\r\\nJoin us\\xa0\\xa0Live Febuary 17th 2026 @ 1:00PM EST. https://assets.sdtimes.com/security-journey-21726-live-web\\r\\n\\r\\nRegister Now https://assets.sdtimes.com/security-journey-21726-live-web\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Engineering Executive’s 2026 Playbook https://assets.sdtimes.com/Supercast2026executiveplaybook  https://assets.sdtimes.com/Supercast2026executiveplaybook \\r\\n\\r\\n2025 was the year of AI experimentation; 2026 is the year of accountability.
